## Adapter Pattern

### Overview
Adapter Pattern is a structural pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping an object in an adapter to make it compatible with another class.

### Use Cases
- Interface conversion between different systems
- Legacy system integration
- Third-party service integration
- Code reusability without modification

### Implementation Approach
1. Define target interface
2. Create adapter class implementing target interface
3. Wrap adaptee (original class) in adapter
4. Convert calls between interfaces

### Example Scenarios
- Payment gateway integration (Stripe, PayPal)
- Email service providers (SendGrid, Mailgun)
- Multiple database connections
- API integrations

## Builder Pattern

### Overview
Builder Pattern is a creational pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

### Use Cases
- Complex object creation with many optional parameters
- When object construction requires specific steps
- Creating immutable objects
- Fluent interfaces

### Implementation Approach
1. Create builder class with construction steps
2. Implement fluent interface (method chaining)
3. Add validation logic
4. Provide build method for final object

### Example Scenarios
- SQL query builders
- Email message construction
- Complex configuration objects
- HTTP request builders

## Factory Pattern

### Overview
Factory Pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

### Use Cases
- When object creation logic should be centralized
- Runtime decisions about which class to instantiate
- When object creation requires specific configuration
- Implementing dependency injection

### Implementation Approach
1. Define factory interface/abstract class
2. Create concrete factory classes
3. Implement creation methods
4. Add object type validation

### Example Scenarios
- File processor creation based on file type
- Database connection factories
- UI component factories
- Plugin systems

## Singleton Pattern

### Overview
Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

### Use Cases
- Database connections
- Configuration management
- Logging services
- Cache management
- Resource sharing

### Implementation Approach
1. Private constructor
2. Static instance storage
3. Public static access method
4. Thread-safe implementation (if needed)

### Example Scenarios
- Logger implementations
- Database connection pools
- Application configuration
- Cache managers

## Strategy Pattern

### Overview
Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

### Use Cases
- Different variations of an algorithm
- Runtime switching between algorithms
- Avoiding complex conditional statements
- Isolating algorithm logic

### Implementation Approach
1. Define strategy interface
2. Create concrete strategy classes
3. Implement context class
4. Allow strategy switching

### Example Scenarios
- Payment processing methods
- Sorting algorithms
- Validation strategies
- Pricing calculations
- Compression algorithms

## Best Practices

1. **Pattern Selection**
   - Choose patterns based on specific needs
   - Don't over-engineer solutions
   - Consider maintenance implications
   - Balance flexibility with complexity

2. **Implementation**
   - Follow SOLID principles
   - Keep interfaces simple
   - Document pattern usage
   - Add proper error handling
   - Include validation logic

3. **Testing**
   - Unit test each pattern component
   - Test pattern interactions
   - Mock dependencies appropriately
   - Test edge cases

4. **Maintenance**
   - Keep documentation updated
   - Monitor pattern performance
   - Review pattern usage periodically
   - Refactor when needed

## Common Anti-patterns to Avoid

1. **Pattern Overuse**
   - Using patterns where simple code would suffice
   - Implementing patterns without clear benefits
   - Combining too many patterns

2. **Pattern Misuse**
   - Using Singleton for everything
   - Over-complicating Builder implementations
   - Creating unnecessary abstractions

3. **Poor Implementation**
   - Incomplete pattern implementation
   - Ignoring thread safety
   - Skipping validation
   - Hard-coding dependencies

## When to Use Each Pattern

### Adapter
- When you need to make incompatible interfaces work together
- When integrating new systems with legacy code
- When working with multiple third-party services

### Builder
- When creating complex objects with many parameters
- When object construction requires a specific sequence
- When you need immutable objects
- When implementing fluent interfaces

### Factory
- When object creation logic should be centralized
- When you need runtime decisions about class instantiation
- When implementing plugin or extension systems

### Singleton
- When exactly one instance is needed globally
- When managing shared resources
- When coordinating system-wide actions

### Strategy
- When you have a family of similar algorithms
- When you need to switch algorithms at runtime
- When you want to isolate algorithm logic
- When avoiding complex conditional statements

## Conclusion

Design patterns are powerful tools for solving common software design problems. The key is to:
- Understand each pattern's purpose and limitations
- Choose patterns based on specific requirements
- Implement patterns correctly and completely
- Maintain pattern implementations properly
- Test pattern implementations thoroughly

Remember that patterns are guidelines, not rules. Adapt them to your specific needs while maintaining their core principles.
